        <h1>-We are surrounded by technology on a daily basis, whether it be in the form of obvious gadgets like our
            cellphones, laptops, and TVs or unseen background technology. We must adjust to it because it isn't going
            away any time soon. Technology may enhance our lives once we learn how to use it properly. However,
            technology can sometimes make our life more difficult. Everything depends on how we utilize technology to
            determine if it has a beneficial or bad impact on our lives. Let's examine some of the advantages and
            disadvantages of technology in our daily life.</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="mainblog">
        <div class="how">
            <h4>Positive Impact</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="positive">
            <h1>Without a doubt, during the past two decades, technology has made our lives easier. Technology has
                positively touched our lives in a number of ways, from allowing us to communicate with people around the
                world from the comfort of our homes to operating a full-fledged business without a physical location.
                Read more below:
            </h1>
            <p> <strong>1. Technology Boosts Business:</strong> Through better employment practices, error-free data
                collecting and analysis, and improved customer and partner communication, technology has helped
                organizations grow.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Technology Makes Shopping Online Possible:</strong> Online shopping has several advantages,
                some of which include cheaper goods, time, gasoline, and energy savings, simpler item discovery, a
                bigger selection online, and a lack of added pressure.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Technology Has Advanced Education:</strong> Now, education is easier for everyone, no matter
                where you live. Online classes have made it possible for all students to enroll without leaving their
                homes.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Technology Makes Everyday Life Better:</strong> Nowadays, the majority of technology is
                produced to benefit corporations and increase revenue. But technology can also significantly improve the
                way we live every day.</p>

            <h4>Negative Impacts</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="positive">
            <h1>-As much as we value technology for the convenience it has given to our lives, a number of its features
                have had a negative impact on our society in a number of ways.
            </h1>
            <!-- Strong Tag For bold text -->
            <p> <strong>1. Technology Causes Health Problems:</strong> As technology develops, we are more connected
                than ever and it has permeated every aspect of our life. Because of this, technology may have a harmful
                effect on our physical health.</p>
            <p><strong>2. Technology Creates Job Insecurity:</strong> Because machines can now perform duties that until
                recently could only be performed by humans, there is a severe labor shortage. The basic line is that due
                to how effective technology has grown, people aren't necessarily required for labor responsibilities any
                more.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Technology Spawns Misinformation and Fake News:</strong> False information and false news have
                long been distributed online. In actuality, it has persisted for a long time. However, it has grown more
                difficult to distinguish between what is genuine and what is false as a result of all the technological
                advancements that occur so regularly.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Tech Products Lack Longevity:</strong> Because technology advances so quickly, the gadgets and
                digital equipment we use have a short shelf life and become obsolete in a matter of months.</p>

                virtual reality technology and artificial intelligence have created a more immersive and personalized

                    businesses are run. The majority of technology's negative side effects are caused by abuse.</strong>
            </h1>
            <p>
                <strong>-Technology has changed the way that camera equipment is sold, making it easier for customers to
                    access and more easy for merchants and producers to reach their target markets. How we use
                    technology can either benefit or hurt us and those around us. We need to use technology in a
                    healthy, more controlled way rather than blaming the tool. This will allow technology to continue to
                    improve our lives.</strong>
